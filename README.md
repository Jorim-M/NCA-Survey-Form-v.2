# NCA-Survey-Form-v.2
An online survey form I built for the National Construction Authority (Nairobi, Kenya).

Now defunct, the survey was in use between June 2021 and July 2021.

The objective of the survey was to collect expression of interest in registering resource personnel.

This is the second version of the applcation. This version was revised with notes from the good people at NCA.

Once you've cloned the repository and migrated everything to your localhost, it should look like this.
